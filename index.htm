            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
                belonging to diverse fields.[3][4][5] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at
                achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[6] But they often include other aims
                as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[6][3][7] However, there are deep disagreements
                about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some
                conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and
                learning.[8][9][4] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about
                by this process. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and
                dispositions that are characteristic of them.[8][9][4] However, the term may also refer to the academic
                study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as well as the social
                institutions involved in these processes.[9] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the
                Latin word ēducātiō.
